- The services, data and models folders are not functional as of today's date (31.03.2025)
- The descovery of the importance of the index.js file in the root was an eye-opener to as to 
what I'm not covering on the course. It's fun to finally get to deploy something, but a runthrough
of the of the function of this file should have been part of the module.
- Still not entirely sure how the .gitignore file manages to not push the npm's to GitHub, but
they still seem to work
- Still love nodemon!!!
- The login endpoint and authorization has been removed for now, but is certainly something
that needs to be addressed at a later date
